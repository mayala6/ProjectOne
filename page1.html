	Early Years
	</H4>
	
	<p>
	I was born in Durango, Mexico and arrived in the United States in the mid 1990's. I grew up in the McKinley Park
	neighborhood. Growing up I started to become interested in baseball and football.  I enjoyed watching the Chicago 
	Cubs on WGN and my favorite players were Mark Grace and Greg Maddux. When I was 13 years old I began to deliver 
	newspaper on my block, I really enjoyed being a paperboy and also provided for a nice income not a lot kids my
	age had. I delivered The Chicago Sun-Times, before making my deliveries I would always read the sports section which 
	was in the back of the newspaper. I would also take a look at the weather, which wasn't always accurate.

	High School Years
	</H4>
	
	<p>
	I attended Thomas Kelly High School in my neighborhood, it is located at the corner of Archer Ave and California ave, 
	our mascot is the Trojan. I played on the baseball team, pitching and playing right field. Playing on the team 
	provided a great opportinity to meet new friends and travel to different parts of the city when we would play our
	opponents. My favorite subject in high school was history, I was particularly interested in the American Revolution period and 
	the roaring 20's. I originally wanted to be a history professor since I felt that was something I enjoyed.

	After graduating high school I enrolled at the City Colleges of Chicago, I took classes at Harold Washington College, Richard Daley College
	and Harry Truman College. During this time I also worked several jobs, including a car wash, Delta Sonic in which I was a detailer. Also 
	worked in a mailroon for Follett Corporation and worked at Home Depot. After I had enough credit hours I decided to attend Southern Illinois
	University in Carbondale, IL. I was a marketing major in the college of business. I really enjoyed my time downstate, it was the first time 
	I was away from home and at times I was home sick but I kept busy by studying at the library. After graduating I worked for a health insurance 
	company then I took the entrance exam for Chicago Police which is where I currently work.
